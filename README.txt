This is a collection of common helper functions and tool functions used by my 
projects. 

The common_toolx.c/h and simple_hashx.h/c are the header file and the 
implementation of these functions. The static library libcommontoolx.a is 
compiled from these files. Link to this library if necessary.

The other files are used for testing, and they can be ignored.
